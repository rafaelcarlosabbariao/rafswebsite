🔍 Folder-by-Folder Breakdown
📂 content/
Contains the written content for the site in Markdown:

blog/ – Your blog posts

projects/

contributions/ – Projects you’ve contributed to

creations/ – Projects you’ve created

publications/ – Conference talks, articles, papers, etc.

✅ Keep as-is, but:

Consider consolidating contributions/ and creations/ under a single projects/ with a type or tag

Be consistent with frontmatter (date, tags, summary)

📂 data/
YAML or TOML files used to store site configuration, profile info, social links, etc.

✅ Good practice. Use this to separate config from content.

📂 ignore/
🧹 Unknown purpose. Likely legacy or test.

Check if it’s referenced in your config.toml

If not, remove or archive it

📂 public/
This is your generated site output from hugo build or hugo serve.

🚨 You should NOT commit this folder to Git. Add this to .gitignore:

bash
Copy
Edit
/public/
✅ OK to keep locally for debugging, but never in production repo.

📂 static/
This contains files that are served as-is:

.well-known/ – Common for verification files (e.g., SSL or domain ownership)

admin/ – Likely for Netlify CMS if you're using it

img/ – Site-wide images

✅ Good folder. Keep it for favicon, social thumbnails, QR codes, etc.

📂 themes/hugo-resume/
This is the installed theme. Contains layout templates and default styles:

.circleci/ – CI pipeline (optional)

archetypes/ – Templates for creating new content (hugo new)

data/, static/, content/, etc. – Theme demo files (can be removed unless used)

layouts/ – Templating engine (_default/, partials/, etc.)

✅ Generally you should not edit directly — instead, override templates from here into your own layouts/ folder at the root (if needed).

🔧 Suggested Cleanup & Enhancements
✅ Clean Up
Delete or archive /ignore/ if unused

Add /public/ to .gitignore if it’s not there

🛠️ Recommended Additions
Add a /layouts/ folder at the root if you want to override theme behavior

Add a config.toml or config.yaml if it’s not already in root (this defines the whole site’s behavior)

⚠️ Possible Redundancy
You have static and public folders inside:

themes/hugo-resume/exampleSite/

These are demo content from the theme

✅ You can delete exampleSite/ entirely once you've set up your actual content

🧠 Summary: What Does What?
